Implements and documents an AI server for the KUKA LBR iiwa robot using REST

This README will grow as the project continues...

In the production technology lab at THI researchers and students take a look at innovative technologies for production and logistics. Part of the lab equipment are several robots like the Kuka LBR iiwa cobot. For this particular model a REST API has been implemented in JAVA on the robot control itself. This allows the robot to receive instruction, which adhere to the predefined REST API.

The goal of this project is to define the architecture and implement an AI server, which can provide the desired computational power lacking in the robot control. The serverside applications will provide valuable information to the robot via the REST API.

This repository will contain the following:
- my master's thesis for context (German or English)
- REST API implementation on the server side
- Knowledge Graph (Ontology and Database)
- AI Application
- Docs
